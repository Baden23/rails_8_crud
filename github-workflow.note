## GITHUB BRANCH WORKFLOW ##

1. Create a branch: git checkout -b feature-branch.
2. Make changes and commit: git add . / git commit -m "Message".
3. Push the branch to GitHub: git push -u origin feature-branch.
4. Merge into main when done: git checkout master / git pull origin main /git merge feature-branch / git push origin master
5. Optionally delete the branch after merging: git branch -d feature-branch / git push origin --delete feature-branch



### Pull base git and start developing from the core/base rails8 (rails 8, basic blog, rails 8 built-in authentication with seasions,  friendly_id) ###

Yes, you've got it! Here's a quick recap of your workflow for starting new projects or features:

1. Start a New Project or Feature

Pull the latest version of the master branch (which is now clean and up to date).

git pull origin master

Create a new branch for your work:

git checkout -b new-feature-branch


2. Make Changes and Test

Make your changes, run tests, and make sure everything works.


3. Commit Your Changes

Add your changes to the staging area:

git add .

Commit your changes with a message:

git commit -m "Your commit message"


4. Merge the Feature Branch into master

Switch to the master branch:

git checkout master

Merge your feature branch into master:

git merge new-feature-branch


5. Push the Changes to the Remote Repository

Push the master branch to the remote repository:

git push origin master


6. Clean Up

Optionally, delete your feature branch after merging:

git branch -d new-feature-branch
git push origin --delete new-feature-branch



---

This workflow will keep your master branch clean, with a clear history of feature additions, and your remote repository will be up to date.
